Eazhisai React demo (created from your uploaded ZIP)

How to run:
1. npm install
2. npm start

This project uses Create React App structure and Tailwind CSS. Since this environment does not run npm, run the above commands locally.
Tailwind setup is included (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js). If Tailwind styles don't apply, follow CRA + Tailwind setup steps.

Mock API is in src/mockData.js (getCourses/getEvents) — these return Promises to mimic fetch calls.
